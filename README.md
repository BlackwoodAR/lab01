# Lab 01 -- Getting started with Git

In this lab we will be introduced to delivery method of all labs, daily assignments, and projects. This method will rely on learning `git`. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)), "Git (/ɡɪt/) is a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows." Basically, it is a more sophisticated Dropbox and allows you to keep your code up to date across multiple platforms.

Follow the instructions below to complete the lab.

## Sign up with GitHub

If you don't already have an account, you will need a GitHub account. You can do so here: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).

## Cloning and Forking a Repo

First, what is a repo and why would you want to do these things to it? __Repo__ is short for repository which is basically a directory of files and folders. Think of your GitHub account as a large folder containing other folders (repos). Each repo is a different project, or in this case, lab. If you just created a GitHub account, then you don't have any repos yet. We are going to change that.

This is where cloning comes in. You need to copy (or clone) the `lab01` repo into your account. This way you can edit/add files. To do this we need to do the following:

1. Open `Git Bash` on your machine.
